# MIMIC Mortality Prediction using Decision Trees

This project was made as part of machine learning coursework. I have attached the problem statement along with the dataset used and codes for this project.

## ðŸ“‹ Assignment Overview

This project focuses on building classification models to predict in-hospital mortality of ICU patients based on their vital signs (Heart Rate, Respiratory Rate, SpO2, Blood Pressure and Pulse). The goal is to use decision tree-based algorithms (ID3, CART, Random Forest and Gradient Boosted Trees) to learn from the given MIMIC dataset and accurately classify whether a patient will survive or not during their hospital stay.

Dataset:
Vital signs data for patients (221 and 230) provided in CSV format.
