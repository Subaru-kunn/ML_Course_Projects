# Diabetes Type Prediction using Naive Bayes and Perceptron

This project was made as part of machine learning coursework. I have attached the problem statement along with the dataset used and codes for this project.

## ðŸ“‹ Assignment Overview
This project implements and compares two machine learning modelsâ€” **Gaussian Naive Bayes** and **Perceptron** to classify whether a patient is diabetic or not, based on four key features: **age**, **blood sugar level (glucose)**, **insulin level** and **BMI**.

The final models are deployed via a **Flask backend** and served to a simple **JavaScript-based frontend** for real-time predictions.
