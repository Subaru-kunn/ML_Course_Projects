# California Housing Data Exploration and Preprocessing

This project was made as part of machine learning coursework. I have attached the problem statement along with the dataset used and codes for this project.

## ðŸ“‹ Assignment Overview

The project involves:
- Understanding and visualizing the data
- Cleaning and preprocessing
- Dealing with missing values
- Removing duplicates
- Encoding categorical data
- Generating various visualizations (scatter plots, KDE, heatmaps, box plots)
- Scaling features using multiple standard techniques
- Drawing insights from statistical and visual analysis

The dataset contains features such as:
- `latitude`, `longitude`
- `housing_median_age`
- `total_rooms`, `total_bedrooms`
- `population`, `households`, `median_income`
- `median_house_value`, `ocean_proximity`
