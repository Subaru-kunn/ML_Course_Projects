# Hand gesture recognition using CNN & Time Series Forecasting using LSTM

This project was made as part of machine learning coursework. I have attached the problem statement along with the datasets used and codes for this project.

## ðŸ“‹ Assignment Overview

1. **American Sign Language (ASL) Classification** using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
2. **Energy Consumption Forecasting** using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks

Both models are developed using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**, with a focus on building robust and efficient architectures for real-world problems.


## Project 1: Sign Language Classification (CNN)

### ðŸ“Œ Objective
Build a CNN model to classify grayscale hand gesture images (28x28) representing ASL letters Aâ€“Z (excluding J and Z due to motion-based gestures).

### ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- CSV file - sign_mnist_train in csv format


## Project 2: Energy Consumption Forecasting (LSTM)

### ðŸ“Œ Objective
Use LSTM networks to forecast daily household energy consumption using historical data.

### ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- Text file - household_power_consumption in txt format
